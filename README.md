# ReadMe

[Kakotopia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kakotopia) is a clean, minimal, light Ghost blog theme built off the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) framework and the default Casper theme. The theme is responsive.

It's currently used to power [our dark future](https://ourdarkfuture.org/).

Fonts are included locally. There are no externally hosted librarires used, everything is hosted locally for maximum privacy. You can choose to shift these resources to external servers (like Google Fonts) if you'd like to sacrifice your users privacy for a small boost in page load time.

Before using, be sure to clear the readme example images out of `/assets/images/` (the files to delete are example.png, article.png, and markdown.png). Additionally, the theme is hardcoded with a Creative Commons release instead of the usual copyright information. To change this, edit line 56 of default.hbs.
